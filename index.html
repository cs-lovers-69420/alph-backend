    <h1>Project Alph: An Intuitive Way to Read and Write Research Papers</h1>

    <h3> Abstract </h3>

    <p>Reading and writing research papers often requires extensive review of past research. Most research papers cite
        past research to provide justification and background to the topic of the paper. To read this past research on a
        traditional computer screen, it is usually necessary to open a new tab with the referenced research paper. This
        makes it inconvenient to switch back and forth between the original paper and the cited one. In VR space, it is
        possible to have multiple documents side-by-side, circumventing this issue. In this project, we develop a
        prototype of a VR application, based loosely on Project Xanadu by Ted Nelson, designed for reading and writing
        research papers that displays these cited papers adjacent to the main paper being read or written. The prototype
        demonstrates the viability of this technique and serves as a proof-of-concept for a future application.</p>
