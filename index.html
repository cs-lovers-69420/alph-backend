    <h3> Abstract </h3>

    <p>The task of reading and writing research papers often requires an extensive review of past research, with many
        papers citing hundreds of documents. These documents provide vital information and background to justify
        arguments presented in the paper. However, reading through these becomes a tedious process of finding a number,
        chasing it down to the citations section, then looking up the new document. Reading these supplementary
        documents on a traditional computer screen becomes even more tedious, with dozens of tabs open to referenced
        papers that were only really needed for one or two lines. Digging through tabs becomes a tedious and
        inconvenient task when a quick glance at a paragraph is all that is needed from a referenced document. The
        emerging popularity of household Virtual Reality (VR) provides a unique opportunity to break free from the
        confines of single 2d pages to instead display multiple documents side by side, with clear connections between
        text citations. In this project, we explore this opportunity through the development of a prototype VR
        application based loosely on the principles of Project Xanadu produced by Ted Nelson in 1960, that would allow
        users to read and write research papers with linked references that are displayed adjacent to the main paper
        being read or written. Through our prototype we demonstrate the viability of this technique in this medium and
        create a proof-of-concept exploration for future applications and research. This report contains an introduction
        to the overall project, shared among all three partners, and a detailed description of Rohit Giridharan's
        contributions to the project.</p>
